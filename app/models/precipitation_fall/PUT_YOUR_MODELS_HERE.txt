Put your trained precipitation prediction model files here:

Required files:
- model.joblib (your trained regressor)
- scaler.joblib (or whatever preprocessing you used)

How to save these from your training code:

import joblib

# After training:
joblib.dump(model, 'model.joblib')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.joblib')
