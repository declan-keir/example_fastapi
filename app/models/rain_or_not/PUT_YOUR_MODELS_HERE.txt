Put your trained rain prediction model files here:

Required files:
- model.joblib (your trained classifier)
- scaler.joblib (or whatever preprocessing you used - StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, etc)
- threshold.txt (optional - if you want to use a specific threshold)

How to save these from your training code:

import joblib

# After training:
joblib.dump(model, 'model.joblib')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.joblib')

# If you have a threshold:
with open('threshold.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('0.5')  # or whatever threshold you found
