# 👋 START HERE - Weather Prediction API Example

**Welcome! This folder contains a complete, simplified example implementation for the AT2 Weather Prediction API.**

---

## 🎯 What is this?

This is a **learning example** to help you understand how to build and deploy a weather prediction API. It's simpler than the main implementation, with lots of comments and explanations.

**You should:**
1. Read through all the files carefully
2. Understand how everything works
3. Use this as a template for your own implementation
4. Modify it with your own models and features

**You should NOT:**
- Copy this exactly without understanding it
- Submit this as-is (you need your own models and customization)
- Skip reading the comments

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to use this exact code?**
A: No! This is an example to learn from. You should understand it and adapt it to your needs.

**Q: Can I use different feature engineering?**
A: Yes! Your features should match what you used in training. This is just an example.

**Q: What if my model is different (e.g., XGBoost instead of LogisticRegression)?**
A: That's fine! The loading and prediction code is the same for most scikit-learn compatible models.

**Q: Do I need Docker?**
A: For Render deployment, yes. But you can test locally without Docker first.

**Q: What if my model files are too large for GitHub?**
A: Use Git LFS (Large File Storage): https://git-lfs.github.com/

**Q: How do I know if my API is working correctly?**
A: Test it! Use the Swagger docs at `/docs` to try different inputs and verify outputs.

## 🆘 Getting Help

### 1. Read Error Messages
They usually tell you exactly what's wrong:
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'` → Install dependencies
- `FileNotFoundError: model.joblib not found` → Add model files
- `ValueError: Invalid date format` → Check date format

### 2. Check the Guides
- **[README.md](README.md)** - Comprehensive guide
- **[DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Deployment help
- Model READMEs - Model-specific help

### 3. Debug Systematically
1. What were you trying to do?
2. What did you expect to happen?
3. What actually happened?
4. What does the error message say?
5. Have you made any recent changes?

### 4. Test Incrementally
- Don't try to do everything at once
- Test each piece as you build it
- Use `print()` statements to debug
- Check logs in terminal

### 5. Use the Tools
- **Swagger docs** (`/docs`) - Test endpoints interactively
- **Browser console** - See network errors
- **Terminal logs** - See server errors
- **Python debugger** - Step through code

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know you're ready to deploy when:

- [ ] Local server starts without errors
- [ ] All endpoints return correct responses
- [ ] Swagger documentation looks good
- [ ] Predictions make sense
- [ ] Error handling works (try invalid inputs)
- [ ] Code is well-commented
- [ ] You understand how everything works

---

## 🏆 Final Tips

1. **Take your time** - Rushing leads to mistakes
2. **Read the comments** - They explain why, not just what
3. **Test frequently** - Catch errors early
4. **Ask questions** - Better to ask than guess
5. **Document as you go** - Don't wait until the end
6. **Start simple** - Get basic version working first
7. **Iterate** - Improve gradually
8. **Backup often** - Use Git commits frequently
